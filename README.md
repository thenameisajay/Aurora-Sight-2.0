# Aurora Sight 2.0

## Description

Aurora Sight 2.0 is a web application designed to deliver the latest data on aurora borealis activity in the UK using the Aurora Watch API. This version is a complete redesign of the previous Aurora Sight application, offering a more modern and responsive design. The original application was built using the MERN stack.

## Migration from Heroku to Vercel

We are in the process of migrating all MERN stack projects from Heroku to Vercel. This migration involves rewriting code, redesigning the front end and back end, and deploying the applications on Vercel using the latest tools and methodologies from our professional experience. The estimated timeline for completing this migration is January 2025.
